# Hi, I'm Gift

## About Me

I'm a **software developer** who loves understanding how things work from the inside out. Whether it’s backend logic or frontend design, I enjoy creating tools that make life simpler — and learning something new along the way.

* I like building things from scratch and learning through experimentation.
* I often “reinvent the wheel” — not because I have to, but because I want to know how it turns.
* I value thoughtful conversations, creative ideas, and practical problem-solving.
* I believe in growth, balance, and keeping a good sense of humor through it all.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** PHP, Python, C, JavaScript, TypeScript
* **Frameworks:** Laravel, Vue, React
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL
* **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Linux

## Fun Facts
