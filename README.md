# Hello there! 👋 I'm Gift

* I like building things from scratch and learning through experimentation.
* I often “reinvent the wheel”, not because I have to, but because I want to know how it turns.
* I value thoughtful conversations, creative ideas, and practical problem-solving.
* I believe in growth, balance, and keeping a good sense of humor through it all.
