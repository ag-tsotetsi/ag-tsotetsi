# Hi, I'm Gift 👋

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Software Developer** passionate about understanding how things work from the inside out. I thrive when working with low-level languages like **C**—give me freedom, but not too many restrictions! On the web, I enjoy building applications with **PHP & Laravel**. I also use **Python** and **Bash** for scripting and automating tasks. I use **C#** for creating GUI tools.

- 🍍 Pineapple on pizza is a crime.
- 🛠️ I love building things from source and reverse engineering useful tools.
- 🔄 I tend to “reinvent the wheel”—I just need to know how it works.
- 🤫 Introverted, but fascinated by deep, thoughtful conversations, debate, and a bit of controversy.
- 📚 Self-taught and always learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages:** C, PHP, Python, Bash, Vallina JavaScript & TypeScript, C#
- **Frameworks:** Laravel, .NET
- **Tools:** Intellij IDEs, Git

## 🌱 Currently

- Exploring new ways to automate and simplify tasks.
- Recreating tools I find useful—just for the fun (and the challenge) of it.
