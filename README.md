# Hello there! 👋 I'm Gift

* I like building things from scratch and learning through experimentation.
* I often “reinvent the wheel” — not because I have to, but because I want to know how it turns.
* I value thoughtful conversations, creative ideas, and practical problem-solving.
* I believe in growth, balance, and keeping a good sense of humor through it all.

* Pineapple on pizza is a crime.
* I enjoy solving tough problems and figuring out how things really work.
* I like simple, thoughtful design — in both code and life.
